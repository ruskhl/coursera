                <p>And the dream became reality when, in 1950, Centro Studi Pittori Arte del Vetro, was formed by Egidio Costantini, Fioravante Seibezzi, Armando Tonello, and others, with the intent of having permanent place of business and showroom in Murano. One year later the Centro changed its name to Fucina degli Angeli, on the suggestion of Jean Cocteau. From that point on it was just one exhibition after the other: Basel, Paris, New York. </p>

            <p class="word">"Transparency is like something unsaid in language. It exists, is implicit like a presence that is waiting to be fertilised by light and colour. It is the reflection and mirror of the infinitely changing nature of all things. Glass is intrinsically a pretext for this phantasmagoria of the possible. It is the vehicle for the creative potentiality of light that is manifested within it. Working with glass is always a secretive and difficult experience. And, like the great seafarers of old who navigated by the stars, the great master glassmakers know that as soon as they enter uncharted waters, great skill and above all continuous presence of mind are vital. Glass does not tolerate a moment's inattention or lack of awareness. In this sense, glass is a hard taskmaster, taming the unruly qualities of man and imposing strict discipline, yet at the same offering the opportunity to be a ballet master. These conflicts and contrasts are what power the soaring flight or purity of line. Creator and creation have no choice but to harmonise and blend with each other for the work to exist".<span class="word-said">Michel Random (writer, art critic and journalist)</span></p>

            <p class="word">Nothing predestined Egidio&nbsp;Costantini for a career in glass. He was born in Brindisi in Apulia on 22 April 1912. After the death of his father, a navy captain, the family moved to Venice where Egidio obtained a radiotelegraph operator's licence when he was 18. However, he could not hope to be given responsibilities on a luxury liner at his age and he was taken on by the Circolo Motonautico in Venice. He was promoted rapidly and bacame the director in 1939. But the war broke out and he worked for several years as a cashier at the Banca Commerciale in Venice.<br>
            In 1945, he moved from Venice to Cercivento, the home village of Emilia Dain, nicknamed Mamma Emi, whom he had married in 1937, and started a company for the dry distillation of wood to extract essential oils. This is where he had a revelation that opened up new horizons for him. After one of his furnaces had cooled, he noticed that the walls had vitrified, with a bluish-green crystallisation. This sight fascinated him and he started to dream of making works of art in glass.</p>

        <p class="word">All Egidio&nbsp;Costantini's work is the reflection of his meetings with others, exceptional moments of symbiosis between the concept of one and the materialisation of the concept by the other. He was convinced that he was giving art and artist a new dimention, a fully-fledged means of expression. His strength lay in this conviction, the beginnings of what became his message towards the end of his life. Egidio Costantini did not meet all these artists by chance. He chose them. He considered that affinities were important for collaboration to be fruitful, for the master glassmakers of the Fucina degli Angeli to be able to give a third dimension to the artist's design.
