            <p class="word">"Transparency is like something unsaid in language. It exists, is implicit like a presence that is waiting to be fertilised by light and colour. It is the reflection and mirror of the infinitely changing nature of all things. Glass is intrinsically a pretext for this phantasmagoria of the possible. It is the vehicle for the creative potentiality of light that is manifested within it. Working with glass is always a secretive and difficult experience. And, like the great seafarers of old who navigated by the stars, the great master glassmakers know that as soon as they enter uncharted waters, great skill and above all continuous presence of mind are vital. Glass does not tolerate a moment's inattention or lack of awareness. In this sense, glass is a hard taskmaster, taming the unruly qualities of man and imposing strict discipline, yet at the same offering the opportunity to be a ballet master. These conflicts and contrasts are what power the soaring flight or purity of line. Creator and creation have no choice but to harmonise and blend with each other for the work to exist".<span class="word-said">Michel Random (writer, art critic and journalist)</span></p>

            <p class="word">Nothing predestined Egidio&nbsp;Costantini for a career in glass. He was born in Brindisi in Apulia on 22 April 1912.

        <p class="word">All Egidio&nbsp;Costantini's work is the reflection of his meetings with others, exceptional moments of symbiosis between the concept of one and the materialisation of the concept by the other. He was convinced that he was giving art and artist a new dimention, a fully-fledged means of expression. His strength lay in this conviction, the beginnings of what became his message towards the end of his life. Egidio Costantini did not meet all these artists by chance. He chose them. He considered that affinities were important for collaboration to be fruitful, for the master glassmakers of the Fucina degli Angeli to be able to give a third dimension to the artist's design. Every real work is meditation, communication and new creation.</br> <span class="word-said">"Copying the design precisely would be like dying, both for me and for the artist who gave it to me." - Egidio Costantini</span></p>
